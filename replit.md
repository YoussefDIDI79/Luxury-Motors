## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application follows a traditional multi-page static website architecture using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page represents a distinct section of the dealership experience:

- **Home Page (index.html)**: Landing page with hero section and featured vehicles
- **Inventory Page (inventory.html)**: Vehicle browsing with filtering capabilities
- **Car Detail Page (car-detail.html)**: Individual vehicle specifications and details
- **About Page (about.html)**: Company information and history
- **Contact Page (contact.html)**: Customer inquiry forms and contact information

### Design Patterns
- **Component-based UI**: Consistent navigation bar and footer across all pages
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with hamburger menu for smaller screens
- **Progressive Enhancement**: JavaScript enhances the base HTML experience without being required for core functionality

### Data Management
Vehicle data is stored as JavaScript objects within the script.js file, providing a simple client-side data layer. This approach was chosen for:
- Quick prototyping and development
- No server infrastructure requirements
- Easy modification of vehicle listings
- Immediate data availability without API calls

### Navigation System
A fixed-position navigation bar provides consistent site navigation with:
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu
- Active page highlighting
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Styling Architecture
CSS follows a structured approach with:
- Reset styles for cross-browser consistency
- Component-based styling for reusable elements
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile optimization
- Modern flexbox and grid layouts

## External Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and modern web standards
- **CSS3**: Styling with flexbox, transitions, and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity and DOM manipulation

### No External Frameworks
The application deliberately avoids external frameworks or libraries, choosing instead to implement functionality with native web technologies. This decision provides:
- Faster loading times
- No dependency management overhead
- Greater control over functionality
- Reduced complexity for maintenance

### Asset Dependencies
- **Images**: Vehicle photos and company branding (referenced but not included in current structure)
- **Fonts**: System fonts with Arial fallback for cross-platform compatibility

### Future Integration Points
The current architecture supports easy integration of:
- Backend API for dynamic vehicle data
- Database integration for inventory management
- Contact form processing
- Payment gateway integration
- User authentication systems
